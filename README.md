# Desify ZA - Durban-Indian Catering & Cooking Classes Website

## Project Overview üçΩÔ∏è

**Desify ZA** is a fully responsive, multi-page website for an authentic Durban-Indian catering service based in Cape Town. The site is built using a modern, utility-first approach with Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, vibrant, and flexible design across all devices.

The project was refactored from a single-page layout into five distinct, linked HTML pages to improve site organization and performance.

### Key Features
* **Five Dedicated Pages:** Home, Menus, Classes, Gallery, and Contact.
* **Authentic Design:** Uses a strong color palette (Red: `#C62828`, Gold: `#FFD700`) and custom typography (`Marhey`, `Lexend`).
* **Full Responsiveness:** Layouts adapt seamlessly from mobile to desktop using Tailwind breakpoints (`md:` and `lg:`).
* **Functional Mobile Menu:** Implements a JavaScript-driven hamburger menu for optimal usability on small screens.
