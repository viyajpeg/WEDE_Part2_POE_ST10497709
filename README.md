üé® Styling and Responsive Design (Part 2 Requirements)
Styling and responsiveness are handled using a combination of an external stylesheet and Tailwind CSS utility classes.

1. External Stylesheet (style.css)
CSS Reset: A basic reset is applied to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.


Font Import: Imports the custom fonts (Marhey and Lexend).


Base Styles: Sets the default font-family for the body element to 'Lexend', sans-serif.

2. Layout Structure & Responsiveness
The layout is mobile-first and uses Tailwind utility classes for structure:


Layout: Uses flex for navigation and the Cooking Classes section , and 



grid for the Menus and Gallery sections.


Breakpoints: Media queries are implemented using Tailwind prefixes:

Mobile (Default): Single column layouts (e.g., in the Contact section).


Tablet (md): Layouts transition to 2 columns (e.g., Testimonials and Menus ).



Desktop (lg): Layouts transition to 3 columns or side-by-side elements (e.g., Menus and Contact form/details ).


3. Visual & Interactive Styles

Color Scheme: Uses #C62828 (Red) as the main brand color, #FFB74D (Orange) for accents, and #FFD700 (Gold) for hover effects.



Interactive Elements: Pseudo-classes are applied via Tailwind for transitions and hovers, such as hover:text-[#FFD700] on navigation links and 

hover:scale-105 transition-transform on content cards.
